comment: This term was made obsolete because 'repairosome' has fallen out of use in the literature, and the large complex described in the definition has not been confirmed to exist. The term has also confused annotators.

namespace: biological_process
def: "An intracellular protein kinase cascade containing at least a MAPK, a MAPKK and a MAP3K. The cascade can also contain two additional tiers: the upstream MAP4K and the downstream MAP Kinase-activated kinase (MAPKAPK). The kinases in each tier phosphorylate and activate the kinases in the downstream tier to transmit a signal within a cell." [GOC:bf, GOC:mtg_signaling_feb11, PMID:20811974, PMID:9561267]
comment: MAPK cascades lie downstream of many cell surface receptors and cooperate in transmitting various extracellular signals to the nucleus. One way by which the specificity of each cascade is regulated is through the existence of several distinct components in each tier of the different cascades. The cascades are typically named according to the component in the MAPK tier.

comment: Note that although the many U12-type introns have the sequence AT-AC at the intron termini, some introns with these terminal sequences are spliced by the U2-type spliceosome. The distinguishing characteristics are sequences near the 5' splice site and the branch point sequences of the intron.
